    "Challenge run for improving your skill level.",
    "This run is meant for people who want to challenge themselves and improve their knowledge of the game, but have little to no experience with challenge runs or speed runs and don't know where to start.",
    "This is not a definitive guide, it's just a route that I felt worked well for me, and might be a starting point for someone else as well.",
    "The guide is dynamic: it suggests a series of restrictive rules, but you can choose to ignore one or more to make the experience more bearable.",
    "This is not a speed run guide, as it's missing many optimizations required for competitive times, but you can still play it going fast."
