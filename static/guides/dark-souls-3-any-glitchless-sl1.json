    "This is not a definitive guide, it's just a route that I felt worked well for me, and might be a starting point for someone else as well.",
    "The guide is dynamic: it suggests a series of restrictive rules, but you can choose to ignore one or more to make the experience more bearable.",
    "This is not a speed run guide, as it's missing many optimizations required for competitive times, but you can still play it going fast."
