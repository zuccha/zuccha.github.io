    "**What if Solaire was the chosen undead?**",
    "Play as the wanderer from Astora in an adventure that will bring you across the land of Lordran. The game focuses on the events of the original _Dark Souls_ while combining aspects from different _Fromsoftware_ games, as well as being a throwback at older _The Lengend of Zelda_ titles.",
    "_N.B.: This is only a demo, the game is currently under development. The latest version features only the first area of the game and doesn't include any sound effect._",
    "No release date has been planned, and whether the full game will ever be completed is a question only time will answer. For now, I can only hope that one day I will be able to implement a Bed of Chaos fight that is not worse than its predecessor."
